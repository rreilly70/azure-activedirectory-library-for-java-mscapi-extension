# azure-activedirectory-library-for-java-mscapi-extension

The Azure Active Directory Library for Java MSCAPI project was setup to provide support for using the Microsoft Keystore on Windows from within the ADAL4J library.  The current version of ADAL4J depends on other libraries to perform the JWT token creation and signing.  These libraries currently do not support the use of the sunMSCAPI.  Ultimately those libraries and the ADAL4J should be updated to accomodate this keystore type but ADAL4J is many versions behind the current release of the Nimbus JOSE + JWT and uses classes that are now deprecated in the recent versions of this library.  Since the undertaking is more than i could handle at this moment to make updates and pull requests to the libraries I created this extension library.  It does require some extra step to be able to use it and understandably is not the best approach I wanted to provide a solution to those that may require this support.
